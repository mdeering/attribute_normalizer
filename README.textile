h1. Attribute Normalizer

p. A little normalization goes a long way in helping maintain data integrity.

h2. Recent Changes

* 0.2.0
** Removed the normalization on reads.
** Added out of the box support for CassandraObjects
** Included RSpec matcher _normalizer_attribute_
** Added the ability to define global normalizers
** *Strings are no longer get 'strip' called on them before getting passed on to your defined normalization blocks*

* 0.1.2
** Changed post-normalization attribute assignment to call super to avoid preventing plugins/gems/hooks to work on the same attribute.

h2. Supported ORMs

* Active Record
* CassandraObjects

p. _I will gladly take pull requests to automatically load Attribute Normalizer into your ORM of choice if requested.  To test it out on your ORM just include the AttributeNormalizer module after requiring it._

<pre><code># your_initializer.rb
require 'attribute_normalizer'
YourORM::Base.send :include, AttributeNormalizer</code></pre>

h2. Install

<pre><code>sudo gem install attribute_normalizer</code></pre>

p. Then just required it.  Rails usages is as follows.

<pre><code># config/environment.rb
  gem.config 'attribute_normalizer'</code></pre>

p. It also still works as a traditional Rails plugin.

  ./script/plugin install git://github.com/mdeering/attribute_normalizer.git

h2. Usage

p. Lets create a quick test/spec for what we want to accomplish as far as normalization using the built in RSpec matcher.

<pre><code># spec/models/book_spec.rb
describe Book do
  it { should normalize_attribute(:author) }
  it { should normalize_attribute(:price).from('$3,450.98').to(3450.98) }
  it { should normalize_attribute(:summary).from('Here is my summary that is a little to long').to('Here is m...') }
  it { should normalize_attribute(:title).from('pick up chicks with magic tricks').to('Pick Up Chicks With Magic Tricks')}
end</code></pre>

p. And lets predefine some normalizers that we may use in other classes/models or that we don't want to clutter up our class/model's readability with.

<pre><code># config/initializers/attribute_normalizer.rb
AttributeNormalizer.configure do |config|

  config.normalizers[:currency] = lambda do |value, options|
    value.is_a?(String) ? value.gsub(/[^0-9\.]+/, '') : value
  end

  config.normalizers[:truncate] = lambda do |text, options|
    if text.is_a?(String)
      options.reverse_merge!(:length => 30, :omission => "...")
      l = options[:length] - options[:omission].mb_chars.length
      chars = text.mb_chars
      (chars.length > options[:length] ? chars[0...l] + options[:omission] : text).to_s
    else
      text
    end
  end

end
</code></pre>

The _normalize_attributes_ method is eager loaded into your ORM.  _normalize_attribute_ is aliased to _normalized_attributes_ and both can take in a single attribute or an array of attributes.

<pre><code>class Book < ActiveRecord::Base

  # By default it will strip leading and trailing whitespace
  # and set to nil if blank.
  normalize_attributes :author, :publisher

  # Using one of our predefined normalizers.
  normalize_attribute  :price, :with => :currency

  # Using one of our predefined normalizers with options
  normalize_attribute :summary, :with => :truncate, :length => 12

  # You can also define your normalization block inline.
  normalize_attribute :title do |value|
    value.is_a?(String) ? value.titleize.strip : value
  end

end</code></pre>

p. All the specs will pass now.  Here is quick look at the behaviour from a console.

<pre><code>summary = 'Here is my summary that is a little to long'
title   = 'pick up chicks with magic tricks'
book    = Book.create!(:author => '', :price => '$3,450.89', :summary => summary, :title => title)
book.author  # => nil
book.price   # => 3450.89
book.summary # => 'Here is m...'
book.title   # => 'Pick Up Chicks With Magic Tricks'
</code></pre>

h2. Test Helpers

p. If you are running RSpec there is matcher available for use.  Usage can been seen above.  Include it as follows.

<pre><code># spec/spec_helper.rb
# ...

Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
  # ...
  config.include AttributeNormalizer::RSpecMatcher, :type => :models
end</code></pre>

p. _I will gladly take a patch to add a macro to Test::Unit if someone submits it._

h2. Credits

Original module code and concept was taken from "Dan Kubb":http://github.com/dkubb during a project we worked on together.  I found that I was consistently using this across all my projects so I wanted to plugin-er-size and gem this up for easy reuse.
